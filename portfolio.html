            <p>The purpose of <a href="https://github.com/frankles12/React_VideoPlayer">this</a> project was to
                exercise my working knowledge with React in order to build a
                video player utilizing the Youtube API. Some of the practices I applied in this project are JSX,
                ES6 import statements, component instances, component classes, export statements, user events, and state.</p>

                <h2><strong>VueJS Game</strong></h2>
                <p>Utilizing practices like two-way data binding, style-binding, v-for, v-if, etc. I built a browser
                    based <a href="https://github.com/frankles12/Monster-Slayin">game </a>in the JavaScript
                    framework VueJS. The game is turned based, reminiscent of Pokemon.
                    The player has four abilities, attack, special attack, heal, or give up. Each ability has their
                    own function which manipulates the data properties in order to calculate damage done. I created
                    a stats section that logs what round the player is currently on as well as how much damage both
                    the monster and player incurred during the round utilizing unshift() and some style bindings.

                <h2><strong>Reviews Content Managment System</strong></h2>
                <p>I developed a <a href="https://github.com/frankles12/Video-Game-Review-CMS">content management
                    system</a> with PHP and MySQL. The content
                    management system was built for the purpose of creating video game reviews. The system uses
                    search, input, and delete queries written in the PHP MySQLi extension format. The system manages
                    multiple user accounts as well as an admin account. When a user is logged in they are displayed a
                    page that’s unique to that specific user utilizing multiple search queries to determine which
                    user is which. They then have the ability to insert new game reviews by entering the title,
                    review, and rating of the game. Once submitted, the game review is inserted into the MySQL
                    database and displayed to the page through use of insert and search queries. The admin account
                    has the ability to do everything a normal user does with the added bonus of being able to delete
                    other users reviews utilizing delete queries within PHP.

                <h2><strong>The Craft Bar Website</strong></h2>
                <p>The Craft Bar is a crafting workshop and boutique located in downtown Sarasota, Florida. The store
                    hosts a variety of crafting workshops for people of all ages but also sells products from local
                    artisians in the Sarasota area. The owners of the store Yvonne and Wendy had a dream to create a
                    store that felt magical, unique, friendly, and
                    most importantly fun. My goal when designing their site was to portray that vision as much as
                    possible. I developed the website in Wordpress so that upon completion of the site Yvonne and Wendy
                    would be able to manage and add small changes without any further assistant required from a web
                    designer. The site features a slideshow
                    showcasing images of the store, information about what The Craft Bar is, Yvonne and Wendy's
                    background information, featured upcoming workshops, and an events page where people can sign up and
                    pay for upcoming workshops. You can take a look at the final product <a

                <p>Using HTML5 and CSS3, I created and styled a tip calculator <a
                        href="https://github.com/frankles12/Tip_Calculator">application</a> that users can use to
                    determine how much money they should tip their food server. Using jQuery I created the algorithm
                    for determining the tip amount based on the quality of service, total bill amount, and even if
                    splitting the bill multiple ways.

                <p>Schiller Designs just recently got a face lift with a new direction, as you are currently viewing.
                    Originally I designed Schiller Designs using Twitter Boostrap as a framework. With the revamp of
                    Schiller Designs I switched to the Pure CSS grid system in order to fulfill a more artistic vision
                    with less limitations. You can check out the
                    old website <a href="https://github.com/frankles12/frank_schiller_designs">here</a>.

                <h2><strong>Modeling for Realtime Systems</strong></h2>
                <p>I developed <a href="https://sketchfab.com/frankles">3D models</a> of an axe, treasure chest,
                    goblet, and wishing well for use on a graphical engine like Unity or Unreal. These were
                    modeled using Autodesk Maya to create the base models as well as creating the UV maps to be used
                    later for texturing. The completed models with
                    their respective UV maps were then exported into Substance painter for texturing. I
                    completed this for a school project where the goal was to have finished models that could
                    be later used in video game production.</p>
