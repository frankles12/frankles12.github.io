                    utiling React and JavaScript methods such as prop types, pure functions, .map/.filter, stateless

                    components Some of the practices I applied in this
                    project are JSX, ES6 import statements, component instances, component classes, export
                    statements, user events, and state.</p>

                    damage done. I created a stats section that logs what round the player is currently on as well as
                    how much damage both the monster and player incurred during the round utilizing unshift() & style
                    bindings.</p>

                    community League of Legends. In this forum users can post and delete information on characters
                    from the game. These posts are done through AJAX requests to an external database utilizing PHP
                    and MySQL. Further functionality includes sorting data by name, recently posted, or by the most
                    popular subject. Data visualization was created utilizing chart.js to dynamically pull in current
                    and updated data from the database in real-time to display what characters are currently present
                    in the data set.
