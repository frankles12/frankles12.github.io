                <p><a href="http://173.205.126.140/~crowde8/downtownpour/">Downtown Pour</a> is a website I helped design
                    along with a team of 2 other web designers for
                    downtown Orlando's upcoming event. My main role in the creation of this website was to create a
                    fully functioning gallery page (found on the gallery page) to feature photos from the event. This
                    website was developed fully
                    through Wordpress. </p>

                <h2><strong>(Old) Schiller Designs</strong></h2>
                <p>Schiller Designs just recently got a face lift with a new direction, as you are currently viewing.
                    Originally I designed Schiller Designs using Twitter Boostrap as a framework. I built this
                    version to have a clean professional feel to it and of course I made sure that it was responsive
                    across multiple devices. With the revamp of Schiller Designs I switched to Pure CSS as a
                    framework in order to fulfill a more artistic vision with less limitations. You can check out the
                    old website <a href="https://github.com/frankles12/frank_schiller_designs">here</a>.

                    <h2><strong>Modeling for Realtime Systems</strong></h2>
                <p>I developed <a href="https://sketchfab.com/frankles">3D models</a> of an axe, treasure chest,
                        goblet, and wishing well for use on a graphical engine like Unity or Unreal. These were
                    modeled using Autodesk Maya to create the base models as well as creating the UV maps to be used
                    later for texturing. The completed models with
                        their respective UV maps were then exported into Substance painter for texturing. I
                        completed this for a school project where the goal was to have finished models that could
                        be later used in video game production.</p>

                <h2><strong>The Craft Bar Logo</strong></h2>
                <p>The Craft Bar is a store that will be opening in downtown Sarasota in the near future. I had the
                    pleasure of working with the two founders in order to create a logo that realizes and represents
                    their vision to the community. The logo is just the beginning of The Craft Bar's journey as I am
                    currently in the works building their website so stay tuned!
