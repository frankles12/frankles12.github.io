                    along with a team of 2 other web designers for
                    downtown Orlando's upcoming event. My main role in the creation of this website was to create a
                    fully functioning gallery page (found on the gallery page) to feature photos from the event. This
                    website was developed fully
                    through Wordpress. </p>

                <h2><strong>(Old) Schiller Designs</strong></h2>
                <p>Schiller Designs just recently got a face lift with a new direction, as you are currently viewing.
                    Originally I designed Schiller Designs using Twitter Boostrap as a framework. I built this
                    version to have a clean professional feel to it and of course I made sure that it was responsive
                    across multiple devices. With the revamp of Schiller Designs I switched to Pure CSS as a
                    framework in order to fulfill a more artistic vision with less limitations. You can check out the
                    old website <a href="https://github.com/frankles12/frank_schiller_designs">here</a>.

                    <h2><strong>Modeling for Realtime Systems</strong></h2>
                <p>I developed <a href="https://sketchfab.com/frankles">3D models</a> of an axe, treasure chest,
                        goblet, and wishing well for use on a graphical engine like Unity or Unreal. These were
                    modeled using Autodesk Maya to create the base models as well as creating the UV maps to be used
                    later for texturing. The completed models with
                        their respective UV maps were then exported into Substance painter for texturing. I
                        completed this for a school project where the goal was to have finished models that could
                        be later used in video game production.</p>

                <h2><strong>The Craft Bar Logo</strong></h2>
                <p>The Craft Bar is a store that will be opening in downtown Sarasota in the near future. I had the
                    pleasure of working with the two founders in order to create a logo that realizes and represents
                    their vision to the community. The logo is just the beginning of The Craft Bar's journey as I am
                    currently in the works building their website so stay tuned!

                <h2><strong>Reviews Content Managment System</strong></h2>
                <p>I developed a <a href="https://github.com/frankles12/Video-Game-Review-CMS">content management
                    system</a> with PHP and MySQL. The content
                    management system was built for the purpose of creating video game reviews. The system uses
                    search, input, and delete queries written in the PHP MySQLi extension format. The system manages
                    multiple user accounts as well as an admin account. When a user is logged in they are displayed a
                    page that’s unique to that specific user utilizing multiple search queries to determine which
                    user is which. They then have the ability to insert new game reviews by entering the title,
                    review, and rating of the game. Once submitted, the game review is inserted into the MySQL
                    database and displayed to the page through use of insert and search queries. The admin account
                    has the ability to do everything a normal user does with the added bonus of being able to delete
                    other users reviews utilizing delete queries within PHP.

                <h2><strong>Calotrak Website</strong></h2>
                <p>Calotrak is a prototype application I helped create with three other colleagues that tracks user's
                    calorie intake, suggests workouts, logs meals, and even provides the ability to shop for new
                    fitness clothing. I developed this website using Wordpress as a platform and Divi as a theme
                    tool. The purpose of the site is to showcase our prototype application and explain what it's all
                    about. The site is fully responsive across all devices and browsers. You can check it out <a
