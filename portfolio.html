                <h2>Decoupling Wordpress with ReactJs</h2>
                <p class="summary">Reactive Templates is a single page application templating system built using the
                    decoupled Wordpress Rest API as a backend CMS and React as the framework for designing the
                    frontend. Reactive Templates allows developers complete freedom when designing the front-end
                    while providing familiarity of Wordpress to users on the back-end. Utilizing Advanced Custom
                    Fields, developers are able to specify what components (created in React) are editable by users
                    in Wordpress. React components are completely reusable with one another allowing extreme
                    flexibility when creating SPA templates.</p>

                    and MySQL. Further functionality includes sorting data by name, recently posted, or by the most
                    popular subject. Data visualization was created utilizing chart.js to dynamically pull in current
                    and updated data from the database in real-time to display what characters are currently present
                    in the data set.
