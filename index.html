            <p>Currently I am versed in the programming languages HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. I also
                have experience working with the content management system WordPress through which I have helped
                build a handful of websites for various clients working under <a href="maxmedia.com">MaxMedia</a> as
                an intern. Every website that I build is responsive meaning that it is viewable ony any device the
                user may be using, just like this one! </p>

            <h4>Graphic Design</h4>
            <p>On the graphics side I have experience working with the Adobe Suite products such as Photoshop,
                Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, and Experience Design. I utilize these programs mainly to create
                content for myself or clients that I can use on web pages such as logos and wire frames.

            <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
            <img src="images/resized.jpg" alt="Picture_of_Frank_Schiller">
            <p><strong>My name is Frank Schiller</strong>. Growing up I've always had a passion for art and graphics.
                I found artworks fascinating and art as a digital medium even more so. Originally this led me down the
                path to become a graphic designer. That changed halfway through my college career when I fell
                in love with the internet and began to learn how beautiful of an art form creating websites really
                is. I'm currently a senior Web Design/Development major at the University of Central Florida where I
                continue to learn more everyday. Aside from the serious stuff I'm a fitness advocate and an aspiring
                Pokemon trainer.
