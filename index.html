            <p>Currently I am versed in the programming languages HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. When it

            <p>On the graphics side I have experience working with the Adobe Suite products such as Photoshop,
                Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, and Experience Design. I utilize these programs mainly to create
                content such as logos and wire frames for myself or clients that I can use on web pages.

            <p>Putting a big smile on someone's face never gets old which is one of my main motivations for
                freelancing. Through freelancing I have the opportunity to meet some really great people. Most of my
                freelance projects utilize Wordpress to design and deliver a finished product to the client. In past
                projects I have used plugins such as WooCommmerce, Yoast SEO, Divi, and Events Calender to name a
                few. Aside from the design work I also provide support to help clients migrate their websites from
                one domain provider to a different one.

            <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
            <img src="images/resized.jpg" alt="Picture_of_Frank_Schiller">
            <p><strong>My name is Frank Schiller</strong>. Growing up I've always had a passion for art and graphics.
                I found artworks fascinating and art as a digital medium even more so. Originally this led me down the
                path to become a graphic designer. That changed halfway through my college career when I fell
                in love with the internet and began to learn how beautiful of an art form creating websites really
                is. I'm currently a senior Web Design/Development major at the University of Central Florida where I
                continue to learn more everyday. Aside from the serious stuff I'm a fitness advocate and an aspiring
                Pokemon trainer.
